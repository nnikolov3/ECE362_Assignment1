Most important features of the program:

-It uses circular doubly linked list to enter the data
-After 5 nodes have been added it deletes the first added to the list
-In the "Main" there is only one infinite loop
-The loop function invokes most the functions responsible for the main 


Functions:

-compare
    -Perfoms all the comparison for the special instructions and invokes the specific function based  on the result
    - Holds the instructions for the special character "!" . This part of the program does not have its own function. 

history 
    - Traverses the list from the first element and prints

exit 
    - Exits the program

tokenz
    - Gets the input from the user and it recognizes the white space as a delimmiter
    - The input becomes an array of arrays and then it is printed with a "for" loop

insert
    -Inserts input into the doubly circular LL

get length
    - Gets the length of the list
